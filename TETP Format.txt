Texture Explore Texture Pack (.tetp) File Format

File Header:
	0x00-0x0E = Identifier, "TextureExplorer"
	0x0F      = Version Number. (Current version is 0x01)
	0x10-0x11 = Flags
			0x01 = zlib compressed (All data after the file header is zlib compressed)
	0x12-0x13 = Number of textures in the file. (All data after the texture specified here is ignored)
	0x14-0x1F = Unused

Texture Header:
	0x0     = Texture Format
			0x10 = RGB5A1
			0x18 = RGBA32
			0x40 = CI4
			0x48 = CI8
			0x60 = IA4
			0x68 = IA8
			0x70 = IA16
			0x80 = I4
			0x88 = I8
			0xFE = JPEG
	0x1-0x4 = Texture Address
		The address the texture should be imported to.
	0x5-0x8 = Data Size
		The size of the texture data, excluding the header.
	0x9-0xA = Texture Width
		The width of the texture. The dimensions of JPEG textures are stored in the JPEG Header, so this is not used by them (it is set to 0).
		This is currently unused but may be used in the future to generate texture lists out of texture packs, among other things. 
		(It is not possible to generate a texture entry without knowing the format, address, data length and at least one dimension (or both dimensions and no data length))
	0xB-0xE = Palette Address
		The address to the palette of the texture. Only used by ci4 and ci8 textures (it is set to 0 for other formats).
		This is currently unused but may be used in the future to generate texture lists out of texture packs, among other things.
		(Without it, all ci4 and ci8 textures would have a palette address of 0x00000000)
	0xF     = Unused

The header of the first texture comes right after the file header.
The texture data comes right after its header.
Unless the current texture is specified as the last one in the file header, the texture data is always followed by a texture header.
